# WooCollect Emails

A lightweight WordPress plugin designed to seamlessly integrate with WooCommerce, enhancing customer engagement by simplifying the process of collecting and managing email contacts.

## Description

WooCollect Emails enriches WooCommerce's marketing capabilities by introducing an "E-Mail Optins" tab. This feature activates through the settings and embeds a customizable opt-in checkbox above the terms and conditions on the checkout page. This setup ensures that customer consent for email advertisements is not only obtained but also recorded within the order notes for compliance and verification.

The plugin displays collected email addresses in the WordPress admin backend in two formats:
- A structured table that includes detailed customer information, such as Customer Lifetime Value (CLV).
- A simple text field that facilitates easy copying of email addresses for use in common email clients.

Additionally, WooCollect Emails provides functionality to manually add contacts into a separate table, further enhancing flexibility and control over your email marketing resources.
